# General Progression

In addition to what is described in stats-and-leveling.md,
there are other ways to progress in the game.

Intrinsic Progression: Players get better at the game (duh), so
we could make later levels relatively harder (the ratio of enemy stats to player stats could be higher).

Extrinsic Progression:
We could introduce Consumables and Equipment after a short tutorial level, and put the first shop just before a difficulty bump to
encourage players to purchase items at that point with the money they earned thus far.

We could also introduce a currency system, and have the player earn currency from defeating enemies.

We could implement a Dungeon System, where the player can earn currency and equipment by beating a series of encounters (see: Sengoku Rance).
