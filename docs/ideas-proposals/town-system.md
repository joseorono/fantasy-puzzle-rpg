# Town Menu Options
Item Shop, Blacksmith, and Inn.

# Images
You can use placeholder images for now, just make it work.

# Item Store Ideas

An item store where you can buy special consumables you can use in Battle.

We could add an additional, highlighted slot to the store: Special Offer.

Basically, one randomly-selected item from the shop can be purchased once per stage/world at something like 50% of the original price.
