Base Systems:

- [x] Dialogue system: RPG Maker style. Done by Jose
- [x] Resources System: resources for purchasing and crafting, including coins. Done by Jose
- [ ] Town system (Item Shop and Inn): 3-in-1. They are basically the same code-wise, and could use the same Store slice and everything. Item Shop, Blacksmith, and Inn. (WIP by AJ)
- [ ] Level-up/progression system. (WIP by Edd)
- [ ] Map system: with menus for each map node, and different nodes. Similar to the Fire Emblem The Sacred Stones (GBA) map, the Pokemon Emerald (GBA) fly map, or the Mario World (SNES) map.  (WIP - Mauricio)
- [ ] Battle system: Detailed elsewhere. (WIP by the whole Team)

Second-Order Systems:
- [ ] Inventory system: Will be implemented alongside the Town system. Requires: Zustand store.
- [x] Crafting system: Will be implemented alongside the Town system. Requires: Zustand store, partially implemented Town system. Finished by Jose.
- [ ] Dungeon System. Requires: Properly integrated Map, Town, Battle, and Level-up/progression systems.
- [ ] Save data: not included until we have a clear idea of the data we'll need. Requires: Most of the base systems.
